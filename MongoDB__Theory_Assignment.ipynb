What are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?"],"metadata":{"id":"5kYHxzGWB9qd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["SQL databases are relational and store data in structured tables with rows and columns. They use a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data must be defined before it is used. SQL databases rely on Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data and are usually vertically scalable, which means performance is improved by increasing the capacity of a single server. They follow ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable transactions. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n","\n","NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and can store data in various formats such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide columns. They offer a flexible or dynamic schema, allowing storage of unstructured or semi-structured data. NoSQL systems are typically horizontally scalable, meaning performance can be increased by adding more servers. They often follow the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency), which prioritizes scalability and performance over strict consistency. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n","\n","In summary, SQL databases are best suited for structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL databases are ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured or rapidly changing data."],"metadata":{"id":"ujAlvNhBDuAv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#2. What makes MongoDB a good choice for modern applications?"],"metadata":{"id":"su8ioR3DDt3W"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["MongoDB is a great choice for modern applications because it is flexible, fast, and easy to use. It stores data in a document format that looks like JSON, so it can handle different kinds of data without needing a fixed structure. This makes it easier to change or add new features as applications grow.\n","\n","It can also handle large amounts of data by spreading it across many servers, which makes it scalable and reliable. MongoDB works well with modern technologies, supports many programming languages, and is perfect for web, mobile, and cloud-based apps."],"metadata":{"id":"nYeOFxWODtt5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#3. Explain the concept of collections in MongoDB."],"metadata":{"id":"M-cXOyg9DtkJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In MongoDB, a collection is like a table in a traditional database. It is a group of documents that are stored together. Each document is a set of data in a JSON-like format, and different documents in the same collection can have different fields — they don’t all need to follow the same structure.\n","\n","For example, if you have a database for a school, you might have a collection called “students” where each document stores information about one student. Collections make it easy to organize and manage related data while keeping the structure flexible."],"metadata":{"id":"RcHyVcMDDtav"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#4. How does MongoDB ensure high availability using replication?"],"metadata":{"id":"wm2ao_0UDtQj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["MongoDB ensures high availability through a process called replication. Replication means keeping multiple copies of the same data on different servers. These servers form a group called a replica set.\n","\n","In a replica set, one server acts as the primary node, which handles all the read and write operations. The other servers are secondary nodes, which automatically copy the data from the primary. If the primary server fails or goes down, one of the secondary servers automatically becomes the new primary.\n","\n","This automatic failover process helps keep the database running without downtime, ensuring that data is always available and safe."],"metadata":{"id":"q4TGQnEMDtGh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#5. What are the main benefits of MongoDB Atlas?"],"metadata":{"id":"DTIlgL6xDs8v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based service that makes it easy to run and manage MongoDB databases without having to worry about servers or maintenance. One of its main benefits is automatic scalability, which means it can handle more data and users by adding resources when needed. It also offers high availability through built-in replication and automatic backups to keep your data safe.\n","\n","MongoDB Atlas provides strong security features, like encryption and access control, to protect data. It also works smoothly with major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Overall, it saves time, reduces management work, and helps developers focus on building applications instead of maintaining databases."],"metadata":{"id":"QvokIs0-Dsyv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#6. What is the role of indexes in MongoDB, and how do they improve performance?"],"metadata":{"id":"GTGwAJxADsof"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In MongoDB, indexes are special data structures that help the database find and access data quickly. They work like an index in a book — instead of reading every page to find a topic, the index lets you jump straight to the right page.\n","\n","Without indexes, MongoDB has to scan every document in a collection to find the needed data, which can be slow when the collection is large. With indexes, MongoDB can locate data much faster, improving query performance and reducing response time.\n","\n","Common types of indexes include single field, compound, and text indexes, each designed for different kinds of searches."],"metadata":{"id":"OIIeUlhwDsed"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#7. Describe the stages of the MongoDB aggregation pipeline."],"metadata":{"id":"flW3SiX1DsUn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB is used to process and analyze data in stages, similar to how data flows through a series of steps. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data and passes the result to the next stage.\n","\n","The main stages are:\n","\n","1. **$match** – Filters documents based on specific conditions (like the WHERE clause in SQL).\n","\n","2. **$group** – Groups documents together and can perform calculations such as sum, average, or count.\n","\n","3. **$project** – Selects specific fields to include or exclude in the output.\n","\n","4. **$sort** – Orders the documents based on one or more fields.\n","\n","5. **$limit** – Restricts the number of documents returned.\n","\n","6. **$skip** – Skips a certain number of documents before returning the results.\n","\n","Together, these stages help organize, filter, and summarize data efficiently."],"metadata":{"id":"I50VbGEFDsNy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#8 What is sharding in MongoDB? How does it differ from replication?"],"metadata":{"id":"q3A_kzdiDsCr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Sharding in MongoDB is a way to horizontally scale a database by splitting data across multiple servers, called shards. Each shard holds a portion of the data, which allows the database to handle very large datasets and high traffic efficiently. A shard key is used to determine how data is distributed among the shards.\n","\n","Sharding is different from replication. Replication is about copying the same data to multiple servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. In replication, every replica has the full dataset. In sharding, each shard contains only part of the data, but together all shards make up the full database.\n","\n","In short: sharding = scale out for performance, replication = duplicate data for reliability."],"metadata":{"id":"KyrQrIq2Dr4i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#9. What is PyMongo, and why is it used?"],"metadata":{"id":"X-JgABgADru4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["PyMongo is a Python library that allows developers to interact with MongoDB from Python applications. It provides an easy way to connect to a MongoDB database, perform queries, insert, update, or delete data, and use advanced MongoDB features like aggregation and indexing directly in Python.\n","\n","PyMongo is used because it simplifies working with MongoDB in Python, making it easy to integrate MongoDB with web applications, data analysis tasks, and other Python-based projects.

What are the ACID properties in the context of MongoDB transactions?"],"metadata":{"id":"RUEaQAK9Dran"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In MongoDB, ACID properties ensure that database transactions are reliable and consistent. ACID stands for:\n","\n","1. **Atomicity** – A transaction is all-or-nothing; either all operations succeed, or none are applied.\n","\n","2. **Consistency** – Transactions take the database from one valid state to another, keeping data correct.\n","\n","3. **Isolation** – Each transaction operates independently, so concurrent transactions don’t interfere with each other.\n","\n","4. **Durability** – Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even if the system crashes.\n","\n","MongoDB supports ACID transactions for multi-document operations, making it reliable for applications that need strong data integrity."],"metadata":{"id":"yQmSsKMSDrP-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#11. What is the purpose of MongoDB’s explain() function?"],"metadata":{"id":"n_E4grOYDrGc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The `explain()` function in MongoDB is used to analyze and understand how a query is executed.

In short, `explain()` is a useful tool for debugging and tuning MongoDB queries."],"metadata":{"id":"i60rhrAsDq9B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#12. How does MongoDB handle schema validation?"],"metadata":{"id":"U5DrOXOvDqzf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["MongoDB handles schema validation using document validation rules that you can define when creating a collection. These rules let you specify which fields are required, the data types allowed, or certain conditions that the data must meet.\n","\n","When a document is inserted or updated, MongoDB checks it against these rules. If the document doesn’t follow the rules, the operation is rejected, helping maintain data quality.\n","\n","Schema validation in MongoDB is flexible, so you can enforce strict rules or allow more dynamic, evolving data structures depending on your application needs."],"metadata":{"id":"F9eSjWAtDqpV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#13. What is the difference between a primary and a secondary node in a replica set?"],"metadata":{"id":"_BsjtTeJDqgh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In a MongoDB replica set, a primary node is the main server that handles all write operations and can also serve read requests (if configured). It is responsible for coordinating changes and replicating data to other nodes.\n","\n","Secondary nodes are copies of the primary. They replicate data from the primary to stay up-to-date and can serve read requests if allowed. If the primary fails, one of the secondary nodes is automatically promoted to become the new primary, ensuring high availability.\n","\n","In short: Primary = main writer, Secondary = backup & optional reader."],"metadata":{"id":"RXa8ubDZDqWS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#14. What security mechanisms does MongoDB provide for data protection?"],"metadata":{"id":"K9gDRhl_DqM-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["MongoDB provides several security mechanisms to protect data:\n","\n","1. **Authentication** – Ensures that only authorized users can access the database.\n","\n","2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Grants users specific permissions based on their role.\n","\n","3. **Encryption** – Supports encryption at rest (data stored on disk) and encryption in transit (data moving over the network).\n","\n","4. **Auditing** – Tracks database activities to monitor access and changes.\n","\n","5. **Network Security** – Includes firewalls, IP whitelisting, and TLS/SSL connections to protect data from unauthorized access.\n","\n","These mechanisms work together to ensure that data in MongoDB is secure, private, and protected from threats."],"metadata":{"id":"B37QhRrmDqD6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#15. Explain the concept of embedded documents and when they should be used."],"metadata":{"id":"BKPFcLM-Dp6v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In MongoDB, an embedded document is a document stored inside another document. Instead of storing related data in separate collections, you can nest one document within another. For example, a “user” document might contain an embedded “address” document with street, city, and zip code.\n","\n","Embedded documents are useful when related data is frequently accessed together, because they reduce the need for joins and improve query performance. However, they should be avoided if the embedded data grows too large or changes independently, in which case referencing separate collections is better."],"metadata":{"id":"jkzKWvFqDpxU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#16. What is the purpose of MongoDB’s $lookup stage in aggregation?"],"metadata":{"id":"AHamunjADpnr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The `$lookup` stage in MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline is used to perform a left join between two collections. It allows you to combine data from different collections into a single result set, similar to SQL joins.\n","\n","For example, you can use `$lookup` to combine a “students” collection with a “courses” collection to show which courses each student is enrolled in.
